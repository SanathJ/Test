			'**#3.) Do not spam.** We want quality content over quantity.',
			'**#4.) Negativity.** We want to encourage communication, and excessive negativity doesn\'t do anything for anyone.',
			'**#5.) Stereotyping and Labels.** We look to learn and help grow with our community. This inhibits our mission.',
			'**#6.) Channels.** Contain things to the appropriate channels. Especially NSFW.',
			'**#7.) Hot-button issues.** This is a gaming server - Politics, religion and other hot-button issues are disallowed.',
			'**#8.) Against Riot\'s TOS.** Account selling/buying, boosting and anything else that breaks the Summoner’s code.',
			'**#9.) Against Discord\'s TOS.** https://discord.com/guidelines',
			'**#10.) Dealing with rule breakers.** If anyone starts topics that you do not think are appropriate to a gaming server, do not engage with that person -- just report it to the mod',
